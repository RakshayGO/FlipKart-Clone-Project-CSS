This is a simple CSS project, aiming to replicate the UI of a basic E-Commerce website.

It is well strucured with styling done separately through CSS sheets and highly customizable because of the use of OOP priciples.

It was further useful in upcoming projects as it creates separate CSS for utlities like buttons etc.


The design is fully responsive, it employs media query to work on phones, as well as the units taken are relative to the device so it is compatible with all screen dimentions.
